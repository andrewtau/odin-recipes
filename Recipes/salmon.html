    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is for a Cajun Salmon Dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon</li>
        <li>Sazon Seasoning</li>
        <li>Cajun Seasoning</li>
        <li>Lemon Pepper Seasoning</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>First we'll start off by creating a marinade for the Salmon. Place your Salmon in a bowl and pour a tbsp of oil on it.
            Pour your Sazon Seasoning, Cajun Seasoning, and Lemon Pepper Seasoning onto the Salmon. Mix into the fish until thoroughly combined.
            Cover and place the salmon in the fridge and let it marinate for up to 24 hours. I typically just let it marinate for 30 minutes and it still
            tastes <strong>Delicious</strong>!</p></li>
        <li><p>After marination, take your salmon and let it sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. While your Salmon is acclimating, preheat your airfryer to
            400 degrees F. Once preheated, place your salmon in to the airfryer for 7-9 minutes. Be sure to constantly check on your salmon as all airfryers are differnet
            and some may cook faster than others. Take out once its cooked to your desired doneness.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Serve with lemon or my personal favorite, <em>Sweet Chili Sauce</em>
        </p></li>
    </ol>
