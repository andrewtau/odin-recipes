            First we'll start off by creating the seasoning for the fries to be tossed in once they've finished cooking. In a mixing bowl, combine all the 
            seasonings together and mix around until thoroughly combined. There's your simple seasoning!
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Now cook your french fries as per instructions.</p></li>
        <li><p>
            While the fries are cooking, we can prepare the <em>bacon</em>. Slice the bacon into small bite size pieces and cook on a pan. Once cooked, drain the Oil
            and place on the side until fries are finished.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Once the Fries have finished, immediately combine them with your seasoning either in a seperate bowl or the same bowl. Toss until combined. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Now place your fries in a bowl and to that bowl you're going to add your shredded cheese of choice on top. Place into the microwave for 30s to melt the cheese. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Once the cheese is melted, you can place your bacon bits as well as sour cream on top.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            That's all! Serve with your choice of condiments. Chef's tips: These taste extremely good with <em>nacho cheese</em>. Trust me, don't knock it until you've tried it.
