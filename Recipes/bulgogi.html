    <!--Image goes here-->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is for a Korean dish known as Bulgogi.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Thinly Sliced Ribeye</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>First we'll start off by creating a marinade for your beef. Start by adding to a mixing bowl,
             6 tbsp of soy sauce, 2 tbsp of Brown Sugar, 2 tbsp of Honey, 2 tbsp of Sesame Oil, 1/8 tsp of
            Black Pepper, 3 tbsp of Water, and finish it off with 2 1 tsp of Sesame Seeds</p></li>
        <li><p>Now place your thinly sliced ribeye in the marinade you just made. Let it marinate for roughly
            30 minutes in the fridge. Be careful not to let it marinate for too long as it will affect the texture
            of the meat.</p></li>
        <li><p>After the 30 minutes is up, it's time to cook! Place a pan over medium/high heat. Once the pan is
            hot, place a tbsp or 2 of cooking oil (Doesn't really matter which you use.) Place your meat on the hot pan
            and depending on how you like your bulgogi, cook for 3 to 4 minutes on one side. The longer you cook it, the more
            charred your beef will become. Afterwards, flip it and cook until browned and desired color. I prefer mine a little
            more charred for that 'crispy' flavor.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>Serve with a bowl of hot rice and vegetables of your choice. Enjoy!</p></li>
